# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It uses the Tkinter library to provide a simple and intuitive graphical interface, allowing two players to compete against each other. Additionally, the game includes an unbeatable computer opponent, ensuring a challenging experience for the player.

## Features

- **Two Players or Player vs. Computer**: The game allows two players to play against each other using the `X` and `O` symbols, or you can play against the computer.
- **Unbeatable Computer**: The computer opponent is designed to be unbeatable, making it impossible to win against it if it plays perfectly.
- **Graphical Interface**: The user interface is built with Tkinter, making the game easy to play.
- **Logging**: The game's actions are tracked using an integrated logging system.

## Dependencies

To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `random` (included in the Python standard library)
- `tkinter` (included in the Python standard library)
- `logging` (included in the Python standard library)

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the `tic_tac_toe.py` script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

5. The game's graphical interface will open, and you can start playing.

## Purpose

This project is mainly recreational and also serves as a showcase to demonstrate a simple use of Tkinter to create an interactive game in Python. The addition of an unbeatable computer opponent provides an extra layer of challenge for those looking to test their skills.

## Author
This script was created for fun and to demonstrate Python development skills with a graphical interface.
This version highlights that the computer opponent is designed to be unbeatable, adding an interesting challenge for the player.
